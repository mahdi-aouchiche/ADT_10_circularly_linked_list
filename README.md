# Abstact Data Types : Circularly Linked List

Author: Mahdi Aouchiche (<https://github.com/mahdi-aouchiche/ADT_10_circularly_linked_list>)

Use a circularly linked list to solve the **Josephus problem**, which is, â€œWho
is the last person standing?"

* Input:
  * A file that contains names of people in the circle (each name is a string written on a new line).
  * A number of a person to start counting from.
  * k : the number of people to skip (example: if k = 2, skip 2 people then execute the 3rd person).
  
* Output: the name of the lucky survivor.
